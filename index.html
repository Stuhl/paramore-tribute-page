        <span class="date-styling">2005</span> · The band just started out with "All we know is falling" debuting in 26th of July. The Paramore name goes back to a birth name of the bassist of the band. The band members liked the name so much that they adopted the name for the band. The band style is alternative-rock but since has changed over the course of the band's lifetime.

      <p id="picture-2013-content">
        <span class="date-styling">2013</span> · The band had very good releases such as "RIOT" from 2007 with their hit track "Misery Business". Altough they had good success they wanted to go a bit abroad with their style so they released a new studio album called "Paramore". It still utilized their alternative-rock rootes but they did a bit of freestyle regarding some tracks. <br /> <br />
        Also some former band members left.
      </p>
      <p id="picture-2017-content">
        <span class="date-styling">2017</span> · After a long time without any major release the band decided to make another studio album. This time though they really altered their style to a mixture of some alternative-rock sounds and a retro-upbeat sound. The sum of this is "After laughter" that released in 2017. With "Hard Times" that is counting 87 million views on Youtube is remarkable. <br /> <br />
        Also a former member that has once left the band - Zac Farro - rejoined the band to be the drummer again.
